This plugin adds location functionality for photos uploaded with Tidypics plugin.

If photos contain Latitude & Longitude data on exif information, the location of the photo is auto-detected and is saved automatically.

Alternatively the user can set the photo location when editing the images.

On plugin settings, the administrator can run a batch script for existing photos geolocation.
